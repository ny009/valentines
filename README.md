## Valentine's day app

This app is a an extended implementation of something this https://valentine.mewtru.com/ website.

This app allows people to ask someone out on a date and get to a passcode if they agree to go on a date.

If they get the passcode right, the app automatically sends a calendar invite on their dates' google calendar using google's calendar API  with hard coded (for now) values.

A future implementation would include a much more configurable website. :D

This was a really fun project made hastily before Valentine's day so the code quality is also a bit unrefined. 

Hope you enjoy it as much as i did!
